Tags are going to be somewhat like "labels" in gmail, as opposed to
"random metadata"

First, just focus on pages, eventually let you do all entries. Tags
can contain spaces. Tags are a general property of revisions, and thus
are versioned, etc.

Questions : what happens when the tag set is auto-updated out from underneath you? 


Page UI goals
=======================

Easy to add / autocomplete tags
Hard to misspell a particular tag
Easy keyboard shortcut use
Aesthetically pleasing
At most one, maybe two tags

Let you search by your tags, all tags

Click window shows you your tags


Search: 
let you search by tags, conjunctions of tags, etc. 
multikey search will let us conjunctively search, and regex searches will 
let us search case-insensitively for autocomplete


Mongo Tag Backend
======================

Backend: 
http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Full+Text+Search+in+Mongo
http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Multikeys
http://cookbook.mongodb.org/patterns/count_tags/


Mongo : db.collection.ensureIndex({revdoc.tags : 1})

Answering the question : "What are popular tags" is really hard to do
with mongo. Since I don't anticipate there being all that many tags
per doc, maybe the right thing is to do the page-update delta and
simultaneously inc/dec the tags?

That is, create a separate "tags" collection and just atomically
increment/decrement the docs?
