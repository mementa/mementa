WYSIWYG text editing

LaTeX formula insertion / editing (possibly WYSIWYG)

The ability to add a link to another page and in real-time get completion suggestions


Figures
================
Upload from R? 
Add captions (text editing)
Additional metadata? 

Do we have multiple imags per figure? or is a figure just a one-off thing? 

Can we crop the image?

Page Interface
==================
Each page should work well for up to ~200 entries

Super-condensed view of entries, ala gmail, for bulk hide/show? 
Real-time search? 
Dynamic "view most recent N"?

Say "Add this paper from zotero or instapaper" 

make comments on it
Extract figures from it, comment on them

Miscellaneous
======================
