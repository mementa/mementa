Tags are going to be somewhat like "labels" in gmail, as opposed to "random metadata" 

First, just focus on pages, eventually let you do all entries. Tags
can contain spaces. Tags are a general property of revisions, and thus
are versioned, etc.

Questions : what happens when the tag set is auto-updated out from underneath you? 


UI goals: 
Easy to add / autocomplete
hard to misspell
easy keyboard shortcut use

I love, absolutely love, tag-it. 

Search: 
let you search by tags, conjunctions of tags, etc. 
multikey search will let us conjunctively search, and regex searches will 
let us search case-insensitively for autocomplete
