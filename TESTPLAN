Okay, for the page-editing code, the test plan here is going to be
pretty awesome. In particular, we want to be able to simulate and
script all possible manner of user interactions. Since the interface
is entirely asynchronous, 

External modules: 

"The thing that dispatches updates about entry values" 
"The thing that dispatches page deltas, creating andsorting entry divs" 

"The central thing that pretends its an ajax server" 



DocDB: The query interface to all document requests. If you want an
entry or a revision, ask through this inteface. This will be cached,
possibly using client-side storage. All queries return promises. 

Server: The interface to remote state, which does the following: 

server.create_new_entry(class, info)
server.page_new()
server.page_update()
server.entry_update()
server.get_entry() 
server.get_rev()   

The latter two are direct methods to query for an entry or a rev, and should not
in general be used by client-side code

The server emits two classes of events: 
page-update
entry-update

note there is no rev updates since revs are constant

Server(domnode) 

then to bind to the events, ust do 
$(server_dom).bind

Tests I want to run
==================================

edit/cancel with a remove : check for notification logic

4. Edit save cycle
3. test entry-rev-update logic, all still in view

-----
4. Try and pin, but there's a remove. Check that the remove happens, and that
the notification div is present
5. Try and pin, but there's a hide. Check that there's a notification. [FIXME: still need to figure out this UI]
6. Try and pin, and there's a different pin in the middle

make sure revid is always correct
make sure unpinning works

When we edit/save an entry, do the other copies of that entry auto-update?
