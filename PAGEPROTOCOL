Pages are the riskiest point of user-interaction. There is maximal
risk that two or more suers will edit a page simultaneously, and
potentially come into conflict.

There are five operations that can happen when editing a page: 

(A)DD : add a new entry to the page
(M)OVE : move an entry around (change the order)
(H)IDE : hide
(R)EMOVE : remove 
META(D)ATA : set title, etc. 

The interface here is as follows [single user case] 

1. When looking at a page, the user makes a change
2. the element is greyed out / some sort of pending visual indication is given
3. put the change request to the server, in the form of an updated doc
4. This is a compare-and-swap operation
5. the page is updated to reflect its understanding of the current state. 


Concerns: 

rapid-fire succession of mutation events. 

Say you click "hide" on two entries in rapid succession. Both go to
pending, but then the full-state-response to entry A's requestwill
contain "HIDE=false" for entry B. Thus entry B cannot "un-busy" from simply
any state update, but rather must wait until it's associated state update. 

Two people editing: 
The app will poll the server once ever N seconds for the current state. Eventually, 
we'd like to do this with something like websockets/server-sent events, but the
server infrastructure totally isn't there at the moment. 

In the event of page-editing conflicts, should there be an
un-conflict-resolvable state, visual feedback will be given. For
example, if a user is editing an entry that another user removes from the page, 
the user will be given notification that "FOO has removed this entry from the page, 
and upon save it will be hidden" Of course, the entry is not really lost. 

-------------------------------------

You cannot use entry id / head as UUID because you could have the same
entry multiple times on a page!



What is the unique ID for each Div? Do we render into pages or do we 

To edit the page, don't over-optimize right now: 

for adding an entry: 

1. tell the server to create the new entry
2. when you get the response, then perform the add operation to the doc
3. compare-and-swap the updates, once it goes through, render
4. broadcast the updates to the page doc
5. set the entry status to edit -- and possibly focus

Entries organization

create_entry_view_div
  render_entry
    render_entry_rev_view

Think about this somewhat carefully: 
<entry-wrapper>
<entry> 
<revision> 


<div entry_id = foo centry_class = bar rev_id = baz class='entry>
