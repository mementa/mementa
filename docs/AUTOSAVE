Autosave functionality is completely out of band from the normal FSM
interface. Upon an entry of the right class transitioning to "edit" mode, 
a timer will start that will begin periodically saving the 

entry, revision, time, content

Now, should a "save" return successful, this entry will be deleted


Questions we need to answer: 

For a given revision, do we want to store autosave data? 

What if I edit an entry, fail to save, and someone else saves in the
meantime? Does this mean we only save one per entry?

Yes, we store our most recent save attempt for a given entry. Thus if
there's an update-out-from-under-us, we can still recover. And if we
accidentally autosave over an old autosaved version, well, fuck it.

If there exists an autosave, do we keep saving the autosave?

"Autosave version of this entry [load] [discard]" 

If there's an autosave for this entry:  
    show dialog
else:
    start autosaving

if save is successful: 

delete autosave
