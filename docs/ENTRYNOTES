Aloha seems immature

Wymeditor: 

There's wymeditor, but it's ugly and I'm not sure how actively
maintained it is. I do like the idea of some modicum of semantic
mark-up though

CLEditor: 
clean, quick, on github

last updated at the beginning of 2011?

YUI rich text? 
Still no YUI3 widget



Ohh, I like Proper

Figure
========================
We want to support a few figure data types, including: 
png
jpeg
PDF

For all of these, we would like to be able to render a certain size
inline, while preserving the link to the original.

Backend: 
have a /files interface where you can put (post) and get files
Files are write-only

Figure: 
title : optional title
caption : optional caption
display-width : max width for rendering each picture

images : array of 
   { file : link to file,
     // denormed data about the file, like size, mime type, etc. 
     
     caption : optional per-image caption? 
   }         
        
Backend operation: 
1. create figure
2. upload file
3. add link to file
4. that's it! 

GUI: 
Create new figure
drag/drop files in
add captions if you want
a "gallery" sort of interface
