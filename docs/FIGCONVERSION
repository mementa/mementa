How do we convert figures? 

Upload canonical fig

Then you can request it scaled to some size, and in some other format

That conversion process is cached in gridfs for easy retrieval
and we really aggressively make use of etags, etc. there

1. look up file in database, get ID
2. look up dimensions / type in DB : if there, return

Cycle: 

the actual converter process is a wrapper around convert that takes in
a "maxseconds" argument and kills the child if it takes longer than
that



1. look up file in DB
2. look up image request properties for this file in the database: 
     if there: 
        if done : 
             if error, return erro
             else return image
        if pending: 
             check if done by inspecting the filesystem
               if done, copy to gridfs, delete files associated
               if errors, delete files associated, set error
             else:
               if too old, retry, update date
             
             
        if done, set pending to "not pending", copy file, or write in error
