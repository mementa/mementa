Users: 

For mementa, there is a single global user list. These users are
stored in the "system" database as the "users" collection.

There's a notebooks collection in the system db, that contains records like: 

notebook { 
    Title
    name : [globally unique name] 
    dbname : [globally unique db name]
    users : list of user IDs
    admins : list of admins
}

An admin can add another user, and can control which users are admin or not. 

The main mementa page lists your notebooks, but that's it -- in
general, the mementa interface is a SINGLE NOTEBOOK interface. But
notebooks, thankfully, are accessed per URL, so a typical notebook
will be, for notebook foo,


/notebook/foo/page
/notebook/foo/ : for the home
/notebook/foo/page/blahblahblah

and then for the API: 
/api/foo/entries
etc. etc. 

Things we do not support:
