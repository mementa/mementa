This is our new attempt to substantially clean up the entry interface
and simultaneous-update code. it's become clear that we can no longer hide
our heads in the sand with respect to asynchronous updates. 


Each page consists of zero or more entries. A page is a canonical
list of pointers to entries as follows:

entry { 
     head : [link to entry]
     hidden : [is this entry by default displayed on the page]
     rev: [link to specific rev, if this entry is pinned]
}

Note that whether or not an entry is hidden or is pinned is a property
of the page.
