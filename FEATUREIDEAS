Each page should work well for up to ~200 entries

Super-condensed view of entries, ala gmail, for bulk hide/show? 
Real-time search? 
Dynamic "view most recent N"? 
"only show me entries of type N"

Say "Add this paper from zotero or instapaper" 

make comments on it
Extract figures from it, comment on them

Miscellaneous
======================
"home page"? 
How do we handle ACLs? 

Store docs / entries in client-side cache so that we don't have to hit
the network so hard?

Autosave in client-side storage so you never-really-lose-anything?
