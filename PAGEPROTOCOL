Pages are the riskiest point of user-interaction. There is maximal
risk that two or more suers will edit a page simultaneously, and
potentially come into conflict.

There are five operations that can happen when editing a page: 

(A)DD : add a new entry to the page
(M)OVE : move an entry around (change the order)
(H)IDE : hide
(R)EMOVE : remove 
META(D)ATA : set title, etc. 

The interface here is as follows [single user case] 

1. When looking at a page, the user makes a change
2. the element is greyed out / some sort of pending visual indication is given
3. put the change request to the server. 
4. wait for the server to return a full update of the new doc. The server handles
synchronization of all the mutate requests, and returns its understanding of the 
current state
5. the page is updated to reflect its understanding of the current state. 


Concerns: 

rapid-fire succession of mutation events. 

Say you click "hide" on two entries in rapid succession. Both go to
pending, but then the full-state-response to entry A's requestwill
contain "HIDE=false" for entry B. Thus entry B cannot "un-busy" from simply
any state update, but rather must wait until it's associated state update. 

Two people editing: 
The app will poll the server once ever N seconds for the current state. Eventually, 
we'd like to do this with something like websockets/server-sent events, but the
server infrastructure totally isn't there at the moment. 

In the event of page-editing conflicts, should there be an
un-conflict-resolvable state, visual feedback will be given. For
example, if a user is editing an entry that another user removes from the page, 
the user will be given notification that "FOO has removed this entry from the page, 
and upon save it will be hidden" Of course, the entry is not really lost.
