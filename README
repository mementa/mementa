Goals: Never delete anything ever


Document model : 

An "entry" is a thing that can be edited. 
Think a figure, a block of text, a link, etc. 

A page is a collection of entries

------------------------------------------

What does the create-edit-save update cycle look like? what portion of
it lives on the client side, vs. the server side? What is safer? How
does the client "know"?

There are two states: 

VIEW
EDIT

EDIT --> save --> VIEW
VIEW --> change -> EDIT

There is a python method where you give it a doc and a version, and it
renders it into a div
