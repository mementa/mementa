build the autoconf'd sqlite lib and install it in the virtualenv



CPPFLAGS="-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3 -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS" ./configure --prefix=$VIRTUAL_ENV

make
make install

then try and get the dynamic lib setup 
   - add LIBDIR to the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution


Hmm, that didn't work -- it's hard to get it to link to the latest version

instead trying apsw

python setup.py fetch --sqlite
python setup.py build --enable-all-extensions
python setup.py install
